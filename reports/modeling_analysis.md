### **Analysis of Model Performance**

1. **Random Forest**

   - **High Training RÂ² (0.997) and Testing RÂ² (0.980):** The model explains most of the variance in both training and test sets, indicating strong predictive power.
   - **MAE & RMSE:** The error increases significantly from training (MAE: 1797, RMSE: 4765) to testing (MAE: 4578, RMSE: 11884), suggesting some overfitting.
   - **Generalization:** Reasonable generalization but with a noticeable increase in errors on the test set.

2. **Gradient Boosting**

   - **Higher Training RÂ² (0.999) and Slightly Better Testing RÂ² (0.981) than Random Forest:** Indicates very strong predictive capability.
   - **Lower Training MAE (833) and Testing MAE (4334):** Shows better error reduction.
   - **RMSE:** Training RMSE (1978) and Testing RMSE (11500) are lower than Random Forest, suggesting that Gradient Boosting generalizes slightly better.

3. **Decision Tree**

   - **Similar Training RÂ² (0.996) but Lower Testing RÂ² (0.969) Compared to RF and GB:** The model is slightly worse in capturing variability in the test data.
   - **MAE & RMSE:** Errors increase significantly in testing, meaning more overfitting.
   - **Conclusion:** Inferior to both Random Forest and Gradient Boosting in generalization.

4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

   - **Extreme Overfitting:** Training RÂ² (0.999) vs. Testing RÂ² (0.571) is a huge drop, meaning KNN is not generalizing well at all.
   - **Drastic Increase in MAE and RMSE:** The test MAE (28856) and RMSE (55057) are huge, confirming poor generalization.
   - **Conclusion:** KNN is the worst-performing model in this case.

5. **Neural Network**
   - **Low RÂ² for Both Training (0.751) and Testing (0.725):** Poor ability to explain variance.
   - **Very High MAE & RMSE:** Training MAE (26761) and Testing MAE (27885) suggest a high level of errors.
   - **Conclusion:** This model is significantly underperforming compared to others.

### **Best Model and Why?**

- **Gradient Boosting is the best model overall** because:
  - It has the highest testing RÂ² (0.981), meaning it explains the most variance in unseen data.
  - It has the lowest errors (Testing MAE: 4334, Testing RMSE: 11500) compared to Random Forest.
  - It generalizes slightly better than Random Forest, which shows slightly more overfitting.

If you need a balance between interpretability and performance, **Random Forest** is also a strong choice. But for the best overall performance, **Gradient Boosting wins.** ðŸš€
